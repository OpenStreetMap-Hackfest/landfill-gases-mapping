# Landfill Gases Mapping

This project was developed on the OSM Hack Fest 2022 which was organised on 20 to 24 June, 2022 at Park Village Resort, Kathmandu Nepal.

This project is still in the development phase and we are going to complete it in near future. This repositroy is freely available to fork or clone. We are committed to make this project free and open as the health related problems are arising day by day due to the production of the land fill gases in the Landfill sites.

We basically focused on the land fill gases production on the Sisdol area which is one of the landfill site where the garbages of the Kathmandu and nearby cities are dumped. The people are suffering from the social, cultural , economic and the health related problems.

In this project, we detected the landfill gases in the Sisdol area and visualized the risk of the Household in the Sisdol area using the building features of the Open Street Map.
